# Terraform AWS Cloud Infrastructure Setup

This project uses **Terraform** to provision a 3-tier architecture on AWS. The infrastructure includes the following components:

- **VPC** and Subnets (Public and Private)
- **Security Groups** for the web and private instances
- **EC2 instances** (web and private)
- **Load Balancer** with Auto Scaling for the web layer
- **IAM Roles** and Policies (if needed)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed on your local machine.
- An **AWS account** with appropriate IAM permissions to create resources like EC2, VPC, Security Groups, Load Balancers, etc.
- **AWS CLI** configured with your credentials by running:
  ```bash
  aws configure

  Setup Instructions

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/terraform-aws-cloud-infrastructure.git
cd terraform-aws-cloud-infrastructure

Install Terraform if not already installed:

    For Linux:

    sudo apt-get install terraform

    For Windows or macOS, follow the instructions on the Terraform installation page.

Set up your AWS credentials: If you haven’t set up AWS credentials on your machine, run:

aws configure

Create and Configure Terraform Variables:

    Copy variables.tf.example to variables.tf and modify the variables accordingly:

    cp variables.tf.example variables.tf

Initialize Terraform: Initialize your Terraform project by running:

terraform init

Apply Terraform Configuration: To create your infrastructure, run:

    terraform apply

    You will be prompted to confirm the execution plan. Type yes to proceed.

Usage

    To modify your infrastructure, update the configuration files in the main.tf and variables.tf files. After making changes, re-run terraform apply to update your infrastructure.

    To destroy your infrastructure, run:

    terraform destroy
